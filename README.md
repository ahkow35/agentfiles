## Related: skillkit

If you manage skills from the terminal, check out [skillkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skillkit) — a CLI for skill analytics, health checks, context budget tracking, and dead weight analysis. Agentfiles gives you the visual browser inside Obsidian; skillkit gives you the operational layer from the command line. They work great together.

## Desktop only

This plugin requires desktop Obsidian (macOS, Windows, Linux) because it reads files outside your vault.
